# Business-Task-Absenteeism-of-Employees.-An-Analysis-and-Visualization
This repository contains my analysis and visualization of the abseenteism dataset. In order to understand why the employees are absent from hours and how many hours they are absent, I have taken the data set preprocessed it using python, integrated the python with SQL using pymysql library, loaded all the preprocessed data from python to SQL then created a dataset to load from SQL to Tableau using SQL workbench and visualized it by creating a worksheet in Tableau. I visualized Age against average probability of absenteeism, Reason of Absenteeism against probability, Transport expense againt number of children the employees have along with the probability of absenteeism.
